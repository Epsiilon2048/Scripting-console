~~ Introduction ~~
This console was my pandemic project. Years after, I decided
to finally clean it up a little and release it. So just know,
it's a touch unstable! Many features were left unfinished,
others untested. If you follow the docs however, you probably
won't run into these issues.



~~ Integration ~~
The o_console object has to be in the room for it to work!
You can do this manually, or you can use initialize_console().

You can open the console itself pressing the tilde (~) key.
Documentation for its language is in the console itself.
